# yolov3-bytf2

* OpenCV is the computer vision library/ framework that we we will be using to support our YOLOv3 algorithm

*OpenCV has inbuilt support for Darknet Architecture.

*Darknet Architecture is pre-trained model for classifying 80 different classes. Our goal now is that we will use Darknet(YOLOv3) in OpenCV to classify objects using Python language.
